# Tailwind CSS Nested Div Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS with deeply nested divs.  The problem is that styles can sometimes behave unexpectedly due to specificity issues or unintentional style overrides.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a solution involving more specific Tailwind classes or using the `!important` flag (although use of `!important` is generally discouraged).
